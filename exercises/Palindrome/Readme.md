# Python program to check if a string is palindrome or not

Given a string, write a python function to check if it is palindrome or not. 

In this file I have stated 5 different python methods to implement palindrome program. 

A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as string. 
For example, “radar” is a palindrome, but “radix” is not a palindrome.

Examples: 

  1. Input : malayalam

     Output : Yes

  2. Input : python

     Output : No
