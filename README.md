## What is Pythonista?

Often in places close and far, we come across those little things which can really be coded to easen the process.
**Pythonista-for-beginner** is a **challenge** to get your neurons together to develop anything and everything productive using Python.
<br><br>
It can be an android code snippet, Javascript function, a python Library usage and anything else you can think of.
So run the horses, pull up the socks, grab a cup of coffee and start to code to develop something productive in pythonista-for-beginner.
